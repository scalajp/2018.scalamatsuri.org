Deep Learning has been on the rise with several frameworks to help ease of development like TensorFlow, DeepLearning4j, Caffe, Torch and more to come.

In this session Karthik and Eduardo would demonstrate how to develop, export, package and deploy deep learning models in production across multiple frameworks.

Topics:  
 - What is deep learning and why now?  
 - Developing deep learning model with Tensorflow  
 - Deploying deep learning model using  DeepLearning4j.   
 - Monitoring models in production.
