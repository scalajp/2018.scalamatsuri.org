In this talk we will explore how to improve our code by implementing some functional programming constructs through a working example in Spark.
We will be able to verify how the separation of concerns (Business Logic/Implementation) will help us to reason about our code and improve its testability.
Not only that, but it will help us future-proof our business logic.
