Monad Transformers. "WAT?" "Exactly"
In this session we'll see what monad transformers are, where their need comes from and how to use them effectively

We'll walk through this rather complicated topic guided by real-life examples, with the noble intent of making our code more readable, maintainable and pleasant to work with.

Finally we'll see how Monad Transformers are just one of possible tools to solve the "effect stacking" and hint at other possible solutions.

WARNING
This talk contains slides that some viewers may find disturbing, most of them containing words like "monad" and/or "functors".

Listener discretion advised.
