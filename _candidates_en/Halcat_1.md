Recently, free monads and monad transformers have attracted increasing attention from Scala programmers. We are also paying close attention to an extension or alternative to these, Extensible Effects.
Dotty, the next generation Scala compiler, will reach version 0.5.0-RC1 on Dec. 16, 2018. It will enable us to use attractive new features.
In this session, I will discuss the design and implementation of Extensible Effects that fit with the new generation of Scala. We will use Dotty's new features including Implicit Function Types, Dependent Function Types, GADTs with Type Members, etc.
