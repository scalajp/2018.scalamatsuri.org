Serverless is a hot topic in the software architecture world and also one of the points of contention. Serverless let us run our code without provisioning or managing servers. We don't have to think about servers at all. Things like elasticity or resilience might not longer be our problem anymore. On the other hand, we have to embrace a little bit different approach how to design our applications. We also have to give up a lot of control we might want and the most importantly we have to use technology which just might not be ready. In this talk, I’d like to discuss if it is worth to use serverless in our applications, what are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. Secondly, I'd like to describe various use cases we were considering serverless and what was the result. And finally, I’d like to talk about how Scala fits into this. This talk should be interesting for everyone who is considering using serverless or just heard this word somewhere and would like to learn more. The talk is a little bit more focused on AWS but the understanding of the concepts I’m going to talk about should be beneficial even if you prefer a different service provider.
