I am Yoshiteru Takeshita, a lead engineer at Geisha Tokyo Entertainment Inc.,which is one of the earliest Scala adopters in Japan.
Typically in my company, one project has 10 or less project members from engineering,
but only a single person implements the server side, and the other members work on the client side.
The server-side engineer in such a project takes care of a wide variety of work, 
not only servers, but also the infrastructure, implementation of the protocol to talk to clients.
As we usually develop large-scale games, we continuously add new features, new game events, etc.
So I am going to show how we leverage the strength of Scala to improve operational efficiency.
