I am working at Emarsys, building our own product - a b2c marketing cloud toolset - and 2 years ago we started a pilot project with Scala. We had no scala developers in this time, so our enthusiastic php developers switched to scala and solve the challenges. After this, we evangelized scala and the functional programming paradigms, and right now we have 2 teams  - 14 people - and more than 10 projects based on scala as well as we still recruiting scala developers.   
This is a hard topic because in Hungary just a few companies that work with this language. I would like to talk about this 2 years years  
how we spread the world inhouse about scala,  
how we get new and new projects  
how we solve our recruitment challenges  
how we retain our quality  
Meanwhile I would like to share our recruitment process, because we are working without HR department and  involve the developers into the hiring steps. I have rough numbers and can show you deeper our ups and downs ergo I can represent all of the details of our recruitment process and what is our fulfillment rate, churn and so on, we measure every step that we take.

In additional, I gave a 5 minutes ignite talk in Chicago 2017 April 20th  - Scala Days - about this topic, and a 10 minutes lighting talk in Lyon 2017 November 2. My goal is to give a longer speech, around 40-45 minutes there I can articulate our story deeper, or just a quick talk as I did it before.
