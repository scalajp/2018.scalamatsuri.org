suggestions:
  - People who are new to Reactive Streams and want to familiarize themselves with the concepts of asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking backpressure
  - People who are already using some implementation of Reactive Streams and would like to compare it to Monix
  - Those who would like to see a live-coded example of using Reactive Streams to solve a real-life problem

Stream processing is a hot topic today and it’s easy to get lost among all the possibilities. In this live coding session we will explore the Reactive Streams approach used by the Monix project - one of the Scala implementations of the Reactive Streams concepts. On an almost real-life example we’re going to walk through both the basics and some more advanced usages of the library.

The code to be presented is available at https://github.com/rucek/reactive-streams-with-monix
