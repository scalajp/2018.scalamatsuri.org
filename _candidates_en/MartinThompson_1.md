 We have all heard stories of how functional programming will solve the multi-core problem. Yet we have also heard stories of how functional programming can have performance issues.  If not , then where have you been hiding that last 10 years? How do we separate the facts from the alternative facts? In this talk we explore the inner workings of our current platforms to resolve the question of whether functional programming can provide good performance and satisfy our multi-core needs.
    
 This talk will cover the most relevant laws governing software performance and put them into context with evidence taken from building implementations to serve the most demanding financial domains.
