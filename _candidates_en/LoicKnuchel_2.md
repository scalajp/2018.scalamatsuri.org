5 years ago I fell in love with functional programming. It started with the incredible collection API that allows to do ten times less code than in Java and since then I go deeper every day.
For this talk I will take a step back and try to highligh why the force is so strong with functional programming and why you should use it right now (if not already).
We will talk about typing, side effects, pure functions, refactoring imperative code, fonctor, monad and all the things you need to create some clear, composable and testable code.
The goal is not to show advanced functional programming but only the 20% that do 80% of the magic !
