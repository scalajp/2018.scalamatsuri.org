suggestions:
  - People interested in functional programming
  - People who have some idea of type classes like Functor and Monad, appreciate the value of those abstraction and want to see what else is out there (knowledge of Functor and Monad not required)

Computing things by traversing data-structures is something we do quite often as functional programmers with the higher order functions like map, filter and fold. A somewhat less used but equally useful function is traverse. In this talk, I'll introduce what it does, why you'd want to use it, and cover some interesting things that you can do with it that were introduced in the Gibbons' and Oliveira's Essence of the Iterator Pattern.
