Parser Combinators is a nice way to describe a language grammar in terms of high-order functions. Graph Databases now widely used in a lot of spheres. There are some query languages for working with such databases. But why use other language if Scala together with Parser Combinators technique is already a good solution? This talk will be about what Parser Combinators and Graph Databases are, why should you care about them, how marry those two things up and where it may be useful. 
All of these with practical examples on a Parser Combinators library I am working on now
