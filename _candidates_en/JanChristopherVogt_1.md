CBT is a build tool for Scala with the prime goal of providing a stellar user and contributor experience. CBT is easy to learn because builds are expressed using vanilla Scala code that even Scala beginners can understand easily. CBT is lightning fast and convenient in interactive use. After 2 years of development CBT is ready to be used and many important plugins have been published. This talk shows you how to build a Scala project with CBT and explains how CBTâ€™s simplicity is achieved.
