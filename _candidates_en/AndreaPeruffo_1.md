  - Let forget the barriers and exploit the Actor model in new domains such as the frontend leveraging 2 awesome projects: Scala.Js and Akka
---
The actor model rules our backend applications, given it's simplicity and powerful abstraction:

Exploiting it's key concepts we will walk into a magic land where Akka takes naturally place into the design and implementation of frontend software.

Trees of Dom nodes will naturally stick up to actors hierarchies,
the ancient art of mastering multi-core development grows happily again
and we are free to reuse our logic and behaviors wherever we like.

Of course, we will do all of this with Akka.Js! :-)
