In this talk, we will explore how can we write a distributed system with Akka, referring to sample example

We will go through distributed systems basics. We will also cover main advantages of Akka to build distributed systems.

We will explore aspects such a latency, throughput, computing power. We will understand how Akka is capable of fault tolerance, resilience. We will explore toolset provided by Akka such as Akka cluster, distributed data, distributed pub-sub in Akka cluster with sample code examples.

But distributed *has known limitations*; I am going to cover these.
