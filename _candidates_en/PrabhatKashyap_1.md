Blockchain is a must-have new shiny toy this holiday season.Enterprises are actively getting involved in building their own takes on Ethereum & Hyperledger.A big part of the hassle is the enormous code one writes without the benefits of a modern functional language.What if we could use Scala to write concise, reusable code & develop a modular blockchain that can be customised as the system grew? This talk will explain the beauty of Scala as a functional programming language to construct effective Blockchains using Scorex 2.It would compare and contrast the code with Hyperledger and Ethereum.
