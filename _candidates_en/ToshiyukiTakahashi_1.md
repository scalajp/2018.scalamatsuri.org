Scala is an object-oriented language, like Java.
However, if you are writing Scala code in Java-like styles, you are not fully leveraging the power of Scala.
What does it look like to write Scala code in Scala's own styles?

In this session, I will introduce Scala features based on familiar object-oriented programming concepts.
I will also discuss how to choose which of Scala's language features to use,
as well as class-design strategies and patterns for taking advantage of those features.
