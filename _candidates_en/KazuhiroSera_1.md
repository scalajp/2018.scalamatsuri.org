In 2011, I started a Scala open source project named ScalikeJDBC. 
Thanks to many contributors, I am still working on the project after six years. 
In the meantime, the Scala community has been growing sharply, and the trends have been continuously changing. 
Despite the fact that the number of developers who work on OSS projects has increased, there are not many developers who have been working on a Scala project for several years. 
In this talk, I will share my experiences and pieces of knowledge through maintaining the OSS project for more than six years.
