In this talk, I will be sharing my experience on streaming processing.
From 6 years ago, I started to use Storm to write my first streaming processing application - Active user counting.
Two years ago, I started to use Spark streaming to implement incremental machine learning application.
Now, I am using Flink to do stateful stream processing and complex event processing.
Along the way, Most of the application in Spark and Flink are written in Scala.
I will explain how does the different framework work in different cases, and why we have to choose Flink in end.
