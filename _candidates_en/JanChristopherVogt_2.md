We all heard about Haskell. Many of us are curious. Some of us played with it. Few had the time to go deeper. I recently had the opportunity to learn Haskell for my job and work on a non-trivial code case. This talk is my experience report and comparison to Scala.

We’ll talk about how it feels to write Haskell code compared to Scala code - what is better, worse or similar. How much knowledge transfers to Haskell. What we can learn from Haskell. How tooling and language features compare e.g. records, pattern matching, syntax. And we’ll live code Haskell through the Scala programmers eyes.
