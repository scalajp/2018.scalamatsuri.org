This is a workshop based on a famous "Akka in Action" book, 
and you will implement and run "the minimum Akka application" described in the book.

Akka in Action (which I wrote the Japanese translated version) describes 
how to design and implement a distributed system using Akka.
The book provides a lot of sample code in Scala, and you can run the samples by yourself
to better understand how things work.

Reference article： https://codezine.jp/article/detail/10548

If you attend this workshop intended for beginners, 
you can listen to the lecture to grasp the feeling of what Akka does,
or of course you can do hands-on code writing, run and debug the application throughout the workshop.
