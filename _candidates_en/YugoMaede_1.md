This is a workshop based on the famous "Akka in Action" book. 
In this session, we will implement and run "the minimum Akka application" described in the book.

"Akka in Action" (for which I wrote the Japanese translated version), describes 
how to design and implement a distributed system using Akka.
The book provides a lot of sample code in Scala, and you can run the samples by yourself
to better understand how things work.

If you attend this workshop (intended for beginners), 
you can either simply listen to the lecture to grasp the idea of what Akka does,
or of course, you can do some hands-on code writing as well as running and debugging the application throughout the workshop.
